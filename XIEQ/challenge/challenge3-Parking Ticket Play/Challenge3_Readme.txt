The City of Toronto has published 2015 parking ticket data with locations, dates, and other information about where parking tickets were issued.  How can you use this data to infer trends that happen in the city when combined with other city, or 3rd party datasets?  Consider how you could work on challenge from a broad sense (i.e. using a certain family of algorithms such as time-series analysis, regressions, and classification) to answer a question such as "what factors contribute to the amount of parking tickets for the city of Toronto?"  Or, attempt to prove a more direct correlation such as "what kind of weather generates the most amount of parking tickets for the city of Toronto?"

There are many different directions this challenge could go, so use your imagination!
