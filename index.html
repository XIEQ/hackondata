<h2>
<a id="11-background-and-motivation" class="anchor" href="#11-background-and-motivation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1.1 Background and Motivation</h2>

<p>In 2011, City of Toronto launched the TO360 Wayfinding Project. The integrated multi-modal wayfinding strategy is comprised of pedestrian, vehicular, cycling and transit wayfinding. The project is aimed to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enhance the overall image of Tonto as a destination</li>
<li>Increase visitors at key attractions, spending in the Greater Toronto Area, boost the local economy</li>
<li>Increase confidence to walk, reduce walk times, promote multi-modal transit and reduce auto use</li>
<li>Improve urban realm, sense of community, pedestrian safety, health and environment</li>
</ul>

<p>The project is implemented in three phases:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Phase 1: Wayfinding strategies (2011 - 2012)</li>
<li>Phase 2: Pilot implementation  (2014 - 2015)</li>
<li>Phase 3: City-wide roll out   (2016 - 2017)</li>
</ul>

<p>Right now, the project in in phase 3. In determining where wayfinding products are required, a number of factors were considered:</p>

<p><strong>Existing Need</strong> - The implementation strategy prioritizes areas where a need for wayfinding currently exists based on:  </p>

<ul>
<li>having high densities of visitors who are unfamiliar with the city</li>
<li>having high pedestrian volumes</li>
<li>having changes in mode of travel</li>
<li>being on a main street</li>
<li>being an area that is difficult to navigate</li>
<li>being close to hospitals, colleges or universities</li>
<li>being close to a city center</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Available Funding</strong> - Further, certain areas may be prioritized as project partners come forward with funding to implement the scheme.  Potential project partners include:  </p>

<ul>
<li>transit agencies</li>
<li>Business Improvement Areas</li>
<li>universities and health care campuses</li>
<li>attractions</li>
<li>city divisions</li>
<li>tourism organizations</li>
</ul>

<a id="12-objectives" class="anchor" href="#12-objectives" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1.2 Objectives</h2>

<p>For the <strong>HackOn(Data)</strong> event, City of Toronto have an interest in exploring a more data-driven methodology to determine the timing and geographic distribution of the required TO360 map assets upgrades. The data-driven methodology may help gain valuable insights from a different and novel perspective and help domain experts to make more effective and reliable map placement plan.</p>

<h2>
<a id="13-our-approach" class="anchor" href="#13-our-approach" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1.3 Our Approach</h2>

<p>We choose an exploratory approach for this problem. We are not aiming to find a "perfect" solution by considering all needs and using all the available data. Instead, our goal is to build a prototype model using the a few of the most important data sources(provided by <a href="http://tranquant.com/">TranQuant</a> and <a href="http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=9e56e03bb8d1e310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD">City of Toronto Open Data</a>). If we can gain insights from the solution and the methodology is actionable, we can refine the prototype methodology by taking into consideration more needs, incooporating more data sources, and using more advanced algorithms.</p>

<p>Among the four aspects of the multi-modal wayfinding strategy, we focus on the <strong>pedestrian wayfinding</strong>. We chose to analyze two datasets from the City of Toronto, available on TranQuant:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Cultural Spaces: This dataset is a compilation of all spaces within the 44 City wards that were available for cultural use for a five year period.</li>
<li>Signalized Intersection Traffic and Pedestrians: This dataset contains traffic and pedestrian volume data collected at intersections where there are traffic signals from 1999 to 2015.</li>
</ul>

<a id="31-dbscan-clustering" class="anchor" href="#31-dbscan-clustering" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.1 DBSCAN Clustering</h2>

<p>We first tried <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#dbscan">DBSCAN</a> algorithm in <code>scikit-learn</code> for clustering. DBSCAN is base on the paper:</p>

<ul>
<li>“A Density-Based Algorithm for Discovering Clusters in Large Spatial Databases with Noise” Ester, M., H. P. Kriegel, J. Sander, and X. Xu, In Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, Portland, OR, AAAI Press, pp. 226–231. 1996</li>
</ul>

<p>This algorithm is aimed for spatial data, which might be a good fit for our case.</p>

<p>The following is a description of DBSCAN algorithm from sklearn:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The DBSCAN algorithm views clusters as areas of high density separated by areas of low density. Due to this rather generic view, clusters found by DBSCAN can be any shape, as opposed to k-means which assumes that clusters are convex shaped. The central component to the DBSCAN is the concept of core samples, which are samples that are in areas of high density. A cluster is therefore a set of core samples, each close to each other (measured by some distance measure) and a set of non-core samples that are close to a core sample (but are not themselves core samples). There are two parameters to the algorithm, <code>min_samples</code> and <code>eps</code>, which define formally what we mean when we say dense. Higher <code>min_samples</code> or lower <code>eps</code> indicate higher density necessary to form a cluster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>DBSCAN algorithm clusters dataset based on two parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>eps</strong> - The max distance between neighbor points to be considered in a cluster</p></li>
<li><p><strong>min_samples</strong> - the minimum cluster size. If it is set to 1, it means every data point will be assigned to either a cluster or form its own cluster of 1 data point. If <code>min_sample</code> is set to be larger than one, then cluster with size less than min_sample will be considered as noise.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The scikit-learn DBSCAN haversine distance metric requires data in the form of [latitude, longitude] and both inputs and outputs are in units of radians.</p>

<h4>

<p>Since in our facility dataset, we need to consider all facilities, we don't want any of them to be classified as noise, so we set <code>min_samples</code>=1. Now our clustering will depend on a proper <code>eps</code> value.</p>

<p>Let's try esp = 1.5, 1.0, 0.7 (km)</p>

<p>Note that <code>eps</code> need to be converted to radians for use by haversine</p>

<h3>
<a id="321-dbscan-clustering-with-eps--15-km" class="anchor" href="#321-dbscan-clustering-with-eps--15-km" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.2.1 DBSCAN Clustering with eps = 1.5 km</h3>

<p><img src="images/DBSCAN_1.5.png" alt="DBSCAN eps = 1.5 km"><br>
As we can see when we set eps = 1.5, the DBSCAN algorithm groups the cultural facilities into 20 clusters based on their geographic coordinates. The figure further proved the concept that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"DBSCAN algorithm views clusters as areas of high density separated by areas of low density. Due to this rather generic view, clusters found by DBSCAN can be any shape, as opposed to k-means which assumes that clusters are convex shaped."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, 20 cluster is not enough. We need a lot more than 20 intersections to place map. Let's adjust the <code>eps</code> parameter and see what result we can get.</p>

<h3>
<a id="322-dbscan-clustering-with-eps--07-km" class="anchor" href="#322-dbscan-clustering-with-eps--07-km" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.2.2 DBSCAN Clustering with eps = 0.7 km</h3>

<p><img src="images/DBSCAN_1.0.png" alt="DBSCAN eps = 1.0 km"><br>
When we set eps = 0.7, the DBSCAN algorithm groups the facilities into 185 clusters. From the plot we can clearly see that the core of downtown is a huge cluster, accounting for more than half of all facilities, while most other cluster only has one facility. This is not a reasonable clustering that we can base on to put maps. Let's try eps = 1.0 km and see if we can get a reasonable result.</p>

<h3>
<a id="323-dbscan-clustering-with-eps--10-km" class="anchor" href="#323-dbscan-clustering-with-eps--10-km" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.2.3 DBSCAN Clustering with eps = 1.0 km</h3>

<p><img src="images/DBSCAN_0.7.png" alt="DBSCAN eps = 0.7 km"><br>
With eps = 1.0 km, the DBSCAN algorithm groups the facilities into 93 clusters. Again, downtown and middle down facilities are in the same huge cluster, and other facilities are rather nicely grouped. Based on these findings we learned that DBSCAN alone is not good enough for our needs, but it can be used to select the areas where facilities are dense and help implement a phase-wise plan for rolling out maps throughout the City of Toronto.</p>

<p>The citywide roll-out of the map placement will be implemented through a 3-year plan as shown in the following map. </p>

<ul>
<li>Year 1: Complete TO360 roll-out within Core of Downtown Toronto</li>
<li>Year 2: Focused roll-out of TO360 map in and around main streets, BIAs and transit hubs</li>
<li>Year 3: Citywide roll-out of TO360 map</li>
</ul>

DBSCAN algorithm can help to select the facilities for each phase of implementation.</p>

<p>Downtown cluster is very condensed, it includes 1064 facilities out of the total 1397 facilities. Let's extract Downtown facilities based on previous DBSCAN clustering(eps = 1.0 km)<br>

<p><img src="images/core_downtown_facilities.png" alt="Core Downtown Facilites"><br>
There are 655 facilities in the core of downtown Toronto</p>

<p>Now, we have three groups of facilities: core downtown facilities, downtown and main streets facilities, and out of core facilities. With these three groups of facilities, we can implement the 3 year phase-wise plan for map roll-out. For each group of facilities we can then use KMeans clustering algorithm to further clustering them into small groups and then we can put a map near the centroid of each cluster of facilities.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong><br>
In current solution, we did not applied KMeans clustering to each of the three groups. Instead, we applied KMeans to the entire facility dataset to make a quick prototype. In future improvement, we can apply KMeans clustering to each of the three groups of facilities.</p>

<p>In this section, we use KMeans clustering algorithm to group cultural facilities according to their geographic coordinates.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong><br>
Here we apply KMeans clustering to the entire facility dataset to get a general idea of how KMeans algorithm works for our problem. </p>

<p><img src="images/Kmeans_200.png" alt="KMeans 200 clusters">
From the above plot we can see that 200 clusters might not be enough because the distance a map needs to cover is too long.</p>

<p><img src="images/Kmeans_300.png" alt="KMeans 300 clusters">
We will use 300 clusters as the prototype for later selection of intersections for map placement.</p>

<p>The following is plot of intersections and the 300 facility cluster centroids. The small blue dots represent intersections, the big black dots represent facility cluster centroids. Our goal now is to find the closet intersection for each cluster centroid. We are going to find a proper intersection for each of the centroid to place map.<br>

<p>Now we have 300 facilities clusters and their centroids, our goal is to find an appropriate intersection to place map for each facility cluster as shown in the following plot. </p>

<p>We compared two cases:<br>
<strong>Case 1</strong>: Select the intersection that is closest to the centroid of a cluster<br>
<strong>Case 2</strong>: Select the three closest intersections to  the centroid of a cluster, then among the three the closest intersections, we select the one with the highest pedestrian volume.</p>

To find the closest intersection to a cluster centroid, we will use KDTree algorithm.</p>

If we consider both distance and pedestrian volume, the average 8 hour pedestrian volume is 16004.4 for the selected 286 intersections. In other words intersections selected by this method has in average 4758 more pedestrian volume or 42% pedestrian volume in 8 Hour period compare to the intersection selected only considering distance. This is a huge difference. Therefore, we will select intersections using the second method, which considers both distance and pedestrian volume.</p>

<p>There is a lot we can do to improve our current solution: 
1. Explore other methodologies. Clustering is only one of the possible methodologies that may lead to a solution. We can also try other methodologies and compare the results. Formulating the problem as an optimization problem is a worth trying direction. Or we can combine clustering and optimization by applying optimization to each clusters.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Using more point of interest data. In our current study, we only used 1397 cultural facilities for building our solution. There is a lot more point of interest(such as hospitals, colleges or universities, attractions, commercial areas, etc.) we need to incorporate to make the study representative.</p></li>

<p>Consider more needs when choose an intersection for map placement. In our current study, we considered distance and pedestrian volume. Other needs we should consider include:</p>

<ul>
<li>having high densities of visitors who are unfamiliar with the City</li>
<li>having changes in mode of travel</li>
<li>being on a main street</li>
<li>being in an area that is difficult to navigate</li>
<li>being close to hospitals, colleges or universities</li>
<li>being close to a city center<br>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Insights from domain experts. City planners have more practical insights on whether an intersection is appropriate for map placement. We can improve our solution by taking advises from domain experts.</p></li>
